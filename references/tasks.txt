The purpose of ToDo GUI is to turn Microsoft ToDo into a full-task schedule manager instead of a single-task manager. With this application you can organize your weekly tasks alongside your single-time tasks - and integrate siri as well!

You can choose which days of the week they arrive - and should be automatically organized in Microsoft ToDo. If for some reason they do not - you can organize them by creation date within Microsoft ToDo itself!

Just follow these steps: Firstly create a Microsoft account with whatever email you want to use - It can be any mail account you please. Secondly click on the "key" tab in this application and sign into that microsoft account in the link that it generates. Lastly copy the "localhost" url that is returned - and paste it in to the application.

These are meant to be one time tasks that this program will automatically add to your lists approaching the date it lies on. To get started - Go to the "refresh" tab and click "refresh tasks"

Tomorrow will display the list of items that are due tomorrow while Tasks will display the items that are due today. "New Tasks" will display any tasks that are added to your reminders from your phone. Go into your Reminders settings in IOS and set "New Tasks" as your default list. Everytime you say "Hey Siri add a reminder for ... at ..." - it will automtaically integrate into the system.

While ToDo didn't have all the features I needed - the API allowed for these features to be included. Let me know what you think and please star my repo if you liked it <3.
