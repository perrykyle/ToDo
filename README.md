# ToDo Project: Manage Your Weekly Tasks (Work in Progress)

![Project Banner](ToDo(v3)\resources\todo.PNG)

## Introduction
Welcome to ToDo Manager, a Microsoft ToDo manager which aims to organize your life by combining all of your deadlines into one application. The benefit of using Microsoft ToDo is that you can integrate this seamlessly with your Apple Reminders, access your tasks across multiple platforms, and enjoy a professional clean interface provided by microsoft. Unforutnately, Microsoft ToDo was created with the implication that only single-time tasks will be added to this application, and not used as a day-to-day task manager. Powered by Microsoft Graph's ToDo API, this evolving project aims to seamlessly connect your weekly tasks and Apple Reminders with Microsoft ToDo. Dive into the existing features and stay tuned for more!
